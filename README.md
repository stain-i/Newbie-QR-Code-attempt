## My process
- I started out by writing the HTML code to put up and arrange all the sections.
- Thereafter I embarked on styling the sections in CSS.
- In CSS i started with givng the body a light gray color as in the design provided.
- Then creating a class for the entire content i.e "index-QR-content", to style the general content.
- I narrowed down the styling to specific parts within the class. I started with the h1 tag, followed by the paragraph tag.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 

### What I learned
- As a beginner with, the QR code component being my real first challenge, it helped reinforce my understanding of the basics of HTML, writing and organizing a HTML page. In addition to that, it enabled me practice the basic styling for text in CSS i had grasped from the learning resources i had used. 
- Currently, i have abit of grasp on the HTML structuring as well as well text styling in CSS.

```html
<div class="QR-banner">
            <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR-code">
        </div>
    <h1>Improve your front-end <br> skills by building projects</h1>
```
```css
.index-QR-content {
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
  font-size: 18px;
  color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
```

### Continued development

Styling text in CSS is an area that I am keen to improve on. CSS Styling for images needs more work and practice, which I will develop along as i undertake more challenges and exhaust more learning resources. In regards to HTML, I am keen on improving the developments I have made on structuring and grouping content, as well as proper applications of tags, elements and useful characters.
